I'm Timo Huennebeck (he/him). I'm a `Front End Developer` who was borned and raised in Cologne, GER - living in `Melbourne, AUS`! üá¶üá∫

I'm also an `automation enthusiast` and attempt to automate `whatever possible`. Whether it be using Google Home to turn on the lights the moment I get home, or using Zapier to connect Trello and LinkedIn to populate a new card with the users information whenever I get a new LinkedIn message! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª




# Featured Projects

When I got some `spare time` (when I'm not practicing tennis, of course!) I like working on a `couple of side-projects`. Here are the ones for 2023! But before we do that. Don't want to `sift through GitHub` to find all projects and their corresponding `live demos`? You don't have! üëä

I've created this [mobile responsive professional portfolio](https://www.timohuennebeck.com), highlighting all the `important information` about me who are worth chatting about within one place!

![portfolio-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107037151/203959158-7bcbd2f3-5490-44ca-ac70-c37f18929427.gif)

`Let's talk demos!`

<br />

## JARVIS - Career Management Platform

[Live Demo](https://jarvis-capstone.herokuapp.com) | [Front End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/jarvis-cap) | [Back End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/jarvis-cap-api) | [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mRpcdBRlbhf98OkEfWMFLu/Jarvis-Cover-Letter-Automation?node-id=0%3A1&t=7dmsTKll8KMuscNX-0)

Finding a job can be `time-consuming` and stressful! 

Jarvis aims to solve this problem - allowing users to `track the status of their networking connections` as well as `job applications` while saving them 5 - 10min. per application, on average.

It's time to put an end to the stress of searching for jobs! ü§∑üèª

![jarvis-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107037151/207115862-82870511-7b4d-4c6c-901b-4ba296754fbf.gif)

#### Front-End:

`React.js` with `SASS` allowed me to create this `mobile-responsive application` in just one weeks time without having to 'sacrifice performance`.


#### Back-End:

`Node.js` and `Express.js` was used to create a `REST API's` that would allow me to receive the data on the front-end using `axios` calls. Furthermore it handled all the users data, leads, companies with their corresponding statuses. 


`MySQL` with a combination of `Knex.js` was used here as well to create a `relational database` allowing me to connect the companies with their corresponding leads.

Furthermore, `oAuth` was used to implement `verification` and `authorization` to prohibit unwanted user access.

P.S. This project will `experience` some `refactoring` until the 31st of `December`. Exchanging existing `SASS` files with inline HTML inline `Tailwind` code and `React.js` components with their corresponding `JS` code for `TS` one to make this code more `readable, modular and performant`.

<br />

## ALIA - Enterprise Collaboration Platform

[Live Demo](https://alia-internal-social-media.herokuapp.com) | [Front End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia) | [Back End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia-api) | [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VcHAeAbxy9oBoIYdIIOwVm/Alia-Internal-Social-Media?node-id=0%3A1&t=HYBsyJciyzeT7IhY-0)

Moving from a traditional to a `remote working environment` can be `frustrating`, but it doesn't have to be! 

Alia's `enterprise collaboration platform` offers employees an opportunity to `find a balance in their life` through a sense of community and collaboration both `on and off the clock`. 

Find out how we are making remote work feel like `being in the same room`! üåª

#### Front-End:

`React.js` with `SASS` was used to create reusable components allowing me to develop an `minimal viable product` faster and ensure a consistent design throughout.


#### Back-End:

`Node.js` and `Express.js` to create an `REST API` allowing me to connect it to the front-end using 'axios` and use it to handle `user accounts`, comments, hubs data, upcoming meetings / events, plus a lot more features.

`MySQL` with a combination of `Knex.js` was used to create a `relational database` allowing me to `connect users` with their corresponding posts, comments, hubs, etc...

Furthermore, `oAuth` was used to implement `verification` and `authorization` to prohibit unwanted user access.

P.S. This project will `experience` some `refactoring` until the 31st of `December`. Exchanging some `existing JS` code for `TS` one to make this code more `readable, modular and performant`.

## INSTOCK - Warehouse Management Platform

This was a `group work bootcamp project`, collaborating using GitFlow and Jira to produce a warehouse platform to manage inventories and warehouses!

It's a `full-stack react app` which uses node.js and express on the backend handling all the data. InStock taught us the `intricacies` of these kind of applications and the need of creating reusable components while working `as a team` - in this case as four web developers with one project manager.

## Music Desktop App

This is just a project to `put to practice` all the programming languages and frameworks I've acquired over the past couple of months, including `react.js, javascript, node.js, express.js, knex.js` and many more! 

It will also allow me to `learn and develop` new personal or business skills which I'll need to learn to make this `web-based application come to life`!

Hello! I'm Timo, an IBM cloud-certified Frontend Developer with a multifaceted skill set encompassing both front-end and back-end development such as JavaScript, React.js, Vue.js, Node.js and more.

"I am committed to merge AI and software development to create seamless user experiences."

I'm also an `automation enthusiast` and attempt to automate `whatever possible`. Whether it be using Amazon's Echo Dot to turn on the lights the moment I get home, or using Zapier to connect Trello and LinkedIn to populate a new card with the users information whenever I get a new LinkedIn message! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª


# Featured Projects

When I got some `spare time` (when I'm not practicing tennis or dancing salsa, of course!) I like working on a `couple of side-projects`. I've created these slides here showcasing all the most relevant work.

I'm Timo Huennebeck (he/him). I'm a `Front End Developer` who was borned and raised in Cologne, GER - living in `Melbourne, AUS`! üá¶üá∫

I'm also an `automation enthusiast` and attempt to automate `whatever possible`. Whether it be using Google Home to turn on the lights the moment I get home, or using Zapier to connect Trello and LinkedIn to populate a new card with the users information whenever I get a new LinkedIn message! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª




# Featured Projects

When I got some `spare time` (when I'm not practicing tennis, of course!) I like working on a `couple of side-projects`. Here are the ones for 2023! But before we do that. Don't want to `sift through GitHub` to find all projects and their corresponding `live demos`? You don't have! üëä

I've created this [mobile responsive professional portfolio](https://www.timohuennebeck.com), highlighting all the `important information` about me who are worth chatting about within one place!

`Let's talk demos!`


<br />

## ALIA - Internal Social Media For Companies

[Live Demo](http://alia-internal-social-media.herokuapp.com) | [Front End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia) | [Back End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/alia-api) | [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VcHAeAbxy9oBoIYdIIOwVm/Alia-Internal-Social-Media?node-id=0%3A1&t=HYBsyJciyzeT7IhY-0)

Moving from a traditional to a `remote working environment` can be `frustrating`, but it doesn't have to be! 

Alia's internal social media platform offers employees an opportunity to `find a balance in their life` through a sense of community and collaboration both `on and off the clock`. 

Find out how we are making remote work feel like `being in the same room`! üåª

## JARVIS - CL Automation Tool

[Live Demo](http://jarvis-capstone.herokuapp.com) | [Front End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/jarvis-cap) | [Back End](https://github.com/timohuennebeck/jarvis-cap-api) | [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mRpcdBRlbhf98OkEfWMFLu/Jarvis-Cover-Letter-Automation?node-id=0%3A1&t=7dmsTKll8KMuscNX-0)

Finding a job can be `time-consuming` and stressful! 

Jarvis aims to solve this problem - allowing users to `track the status of their job application` and create `personalised cover letters` all while `saving 5 - 10min.` per application.

It's time to put an end to the stress of searching for jobs! ü§∑üèª

## INSTOCK - Warehouse Management Platform

This was a `group work bootcamp project`, collaborating using GitFlow and Jira to produce a warehouse platform to manage inventories and warehouses!

It's a `full-stack react app` which uses node.js and express on the backend handling all the data. InStock taught us the `intricacies` of these kind of applications and the need of creating reusable components while working `as a team` - in this case as four web developers with one project manager.

## Music Desktop App

This is just a project to `put to practice` all the programming languages and frameworks I've acquired over the past couple of months, including `react.js, javascript, node.js, express.js, knex.js` and many more! 

It will also allow me to `learn and develop` new personal or business skills which I'll need to learn to make this `web-based application come to life`!
